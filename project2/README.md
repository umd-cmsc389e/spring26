# CMSC389E Project 2 - Logic Gates and Adders

Due: **Friday, March 6th, 2026 at 11:59PM** on **[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1240118/assignments/7536765/)**

## Importing Projects
To import the project, you need to download `project2 TEMPLATE.zip`, extract it, and move it into the `saves` folder of your Modrinth installation folder. The easiest way of doing this is the following:

1. Download `project2 TEMPLATE.zip` from this directory
2. Locate your `./Downloads` folder and extract the contents of `project2 TEMPLATE.zip`
3. Locate the `project2` folder INSIDE of the folder you extracted into
4. Use `Ctrl + X` or `Cmd + X` on the `project2` folder to cut it, saving it into your clipboard
5. Go to your Modrinth Launcher's and navigate to the CMSC389E instance we created during setup. Locate the button next to instance settings and click on **Open Folder**.

6. Navigate to the `saves` folder, and use `Ctrl + V` to paste `project2`
7. Finally, click the `Play` button to open Minecraft, go to "Singleplayer", and you should see **Project 2** has been successfully imported!


## Submitting Projects
Projects will be submitted and autograded via **Gradescope**. If you are not already in the **Gradescope**, the join code can be found in the syllabus. To submit the project, you will need to locate your `project2` world file, zip it into `project2.zip`, and submit it into the relevant Gradescope assignment. Here's a step-by-step:

1. Go to your Modrinth Launcher's and navigate to the CMSC389E instance we created during setup *(same as above)*. Locate the button next to instance settings and click on **Open Folder**.
2. Go to the `saves` folder, right click on `project2`, and compress it to **ZIP File**. 
3. Go to the Gradescope assignment and upload the relevant **ZIP File**.

## Notes

* For any of the tasks, **DO NOT** destroy or move the input/output lamps. We hardcode the input/output locations for the autograder to test your builds. 
* You may build outside of the **Gold Blocks**, but we always provide you with enough space to complete your build inside. 
* To receive directions for each of the tasks, **Middle Click** on the **Book and Quill** inside of the **Item Frame**. If you accidentally destroy them, don't worry - we put the instructions here as well.
* In some parts of the world, we have provided **compact designs** for logic gates/adders. Compact builds make structures easy to incorporate into larger builds. Use these designs for future successive builds; do **NOT** simply copy them for a previous problem.

### **Task 10**: Construct a **4-bit Adder** that adds two 4-digit binary numbers into a 5-digit binary number  
(*Performs **A** + **B***).

Use WorldEdit and the compact **Full Adder** given in the previous module.  
**Note:** We will not touch the Carry In signal. You are responsible for setting it!

### **BONUS Task (1 pt)**: Modify your **4-bit Adder** to build a **4-bit Subtracter** that subtracts two 4-digit (signed) binary numbers into a 5-digit binary number  
(*Performs **A** - **B***).

**Hint:** Use **Two's Complement!**  
**Note:** We will not touch the Carry In signal. You are responsible for setting it!
