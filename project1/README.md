# CMSC389E Project 1 - Tutorial Island

Due: **Friday, February 13th, 2026 at 11:59PM**

Prior to starting **Project 1**, ensure you have went through the entirety of the [Setup README](https://github.com/umd-cmsc389e/spring26/tree/main/setup). 

## Importing Projects
To import the project, you need to download `project1 TEMPLATE.zip`, extract it, and move it into the `saves` folder of your Modrinth installation folder. The easiest way of doing this is the following:

1. Download `project1 TEMPLATE.zip` from this directory
2. Locate your `./Downloads` folder and extract the contents of `project1 TEMPLATE.zip`
3. Locate the `project1` folder INSIDE of the folder you extracted into
4. Use `Ctrl + X` or `Cmd + X` on the `project1` folder to cut it, saving it into your clipboard
5. Go to your Modrinth Launcher's and navigate to the CMSC389E instance we created during setup. Locate the button next to instance settings and click on **Open Folder**.

6. Navigate to the `saves` folder, and use `Ctrl + V` to paste `project1`
7. Finally, click the `Play` button to open Minecraft, go to "Singleplayer", and you should see **Project 0** has been successfully imported!


## Submitting Projects
Projects will be submitted and autograded via **Gradescope**. If you are not already in the **Gradescope**, the join code can be found in the syllabus. To submit the project, you will need to locate your `project1` world file, zip it into `project1.zip`, and submit it into the relevant Gradescope assignment. Here's a step-by-step:

1. Go to your Modrinth Launcher's and navigate to the CMSC389E instance we created during setup. Locate the button next to instance settings and click on **Open Folder**.

2. Go to the `saves` folder, right click on `project1`, and compress it to **ZIP File**. 
3. Go to the Gradescope assignment and upload the relevant **ZIP File**.

## Notes

* For any of the tasks, **DO NOT** destroy or move the input/output lamps. We hardcode the input/output locations for the autograder to test your builds. 
* You may build outside of the **Gold Blocks**, but we always provide you with enough space to complete your build inside. 
* To receive directions for each of the tasks, **Middle Click** on the **Book and Quill** inside of the **Item Frame**. If you accidentally destroy them, don't worry - we put the instructions here as well.


## Redstone Basics

1. **Produce Signal**
   Connect the input and output with redstone dust to produce an output signal.

2. **Extending Signal Strength**  
   Connect the input and output by extending the redstone signal with a repeater.

3. **Vertical Signal Transmission**  
   Connect the input and output by transmitting the redstone signal up a glass tower.

4. **NOT Gate**  
   Wire the circuit as follows:  
   - When the input is **ON**, the redstone torch is **OFF**, and the output is **OFF**.  
   - When the input is **OFF**, the redstone torch is **ON**, and the output is **ON**.  
   Notice, this is a **NOT gate**!

5.  **Comparator Signal Difference**  
   Use a comparator to output the difference between the signal strength of the blue and green inputs.
   *Hint: Use another comparator!*


## WorldEdit Basics
*For these tasks, utilize the WorldEdit mod. Refer to the [Setup README](https://github.com/umd-cmsc389e/spring26/tree/main/setup) for commands!*

6. **Elevate the Crafting Area**  
   Move this little crafting area 10 blocks upwards into the air.

7. **Multiply Your Wealth**  
   Stack this cube of diamond ore 10 times forward.

8. **Apartment Demolition**  
   Destroy this apartment by setting the entire region to be empty! (lol)
